# Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/). I'm just using Typescript (the language I'm most fluent in) this year in the hopes that I don't get tired of it a week in and quit.

## Project structure

The project is structured into directories by day. Each day has a `part-1.ts` and a `part-2.ts`. The input data for each day is fetched in an `index.ts` and the results are printed from the same file. AoC provideds test data for each puzzle, so most of the solutions have tests written for them to help with creating the solution. They aren't necessarily comprehensive, and certainly don't aim for complete coverage, so don't @ me. With that said, pull requests are welcome once I've managed to solve a puzzle myself. My solutions are mostly what's expedient, and may not represent idiomatic Typescript or Javscript. I'll try to refine them when I have time, _if_ I have time.
